# SkillBridge AI  
### Turning Skills into Clear Career Paths

SkillBridge AI is an AI-powered career guidance prototype designed to help students, recent graduates, and self-taught learners gain clarity on career paths that align with their existing skills and interests. The project was built as part of the **AI-Surge Thinking-Wide Final Challenge**, with a strong focus on real-world impact, collaboration, and strategic AI usage.

---

##  Project Overview

Many learners complete their education without a clear understanding of:
- Which career paths suit their current skills
- What skills they are missing for their desired roles
- What concrete steps they should take next

SkillBridge AI addresses this gap by acting as a **career mentor**, not just an information platform. It connects skills to careers, highlights skill gaps, and provides actionable learning roadmaps — all in a simple, accessible way.

This project demonstrates how AI can be used as a **creative and analytical partner** to rapidly design, prototype, and communicate impactful solutions.

---

##  Problem Statement

Students and early-career professionals often feel overwhelmed by career choices and lack access to personalized career guidance. Existing solutions such as job boards and online courses are fragmented — they show opportunities or teach skills, but rarely connect a learner’s background to a clear career direction.

This results in:
- Wasted time learning irrelevant skills
- Career stagnation
- Missed job and growth opportunities

SkillBridge AI was created to bridge this clarity gap.

---

##  Solution Summary

SkillBridge AI is a web-based MVP that:
- Accepts user skills and interests as input
- Suggests suitable career paths
- Identifies missing skills for each career
- Generates a step-by-step learning roadmap

The focus is on **clarity, simplicity, and accessibility**, especially for learners in emerging markets.

---

##  Key Features

- **Skill & Interest Input**  
  Users provide their current skills and interests through a simple interface.

- **AI-Generated Career Suggestions**  
  The system recommends 3–5 relevant career paths with explanations.

- **Skill Gap Analysis**  
  Each suggested career highlights missing or recommended skills.

- **Learning Roadmap**  
  Users receive a clear, actionable roadmap outlining what to learn next.

- **Visually Engaging MVP**  
  Clean, modern landing page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## Prototype Description

The prototype is a **landing-page-style MVP** that visually demonstrates:
- The problem being solved
- How SkillBridge AI works
- Example AI outputs
- A simulated user journey

It is intentionally lightweight and frontend-only to keep the focus on idea clarity and user experience.

---

##  Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — Semantic structure
- **CSS3** — Modern styling, layout, and responsiveness
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — Interactivity and simulated AI behavior
- **AI Tools** — Used for ideation, design assistance, copywriting, and prototyping

No frameworks or backend services were used, in line with MVP constraints.
