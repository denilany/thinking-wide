# Problem Statement

Many students and recent graduates struggle to transition from education to employment. 
They are overwhelmed by career options, lack clear guidance on which skills to learn, 
and often do not understand how their existing skills map to real job roles.

This problem affects university students, recent graduates, and self-taught learners, 
especially in emerging markets, where access to personalized career mentorship is limited.

Current solutions are fragmented — job boards show vacancies, courses teach skills, 
but few platforms connect a learner’s background to a clear, actionable career roadmap.
